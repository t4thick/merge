/**
 * Shortfall refunds for partially fulfilled orders.
 *
 * When staff bag an order and something is not on the shelf, the customer keeps
 * the rest and is refunded for what they did not get. The math here is the
 * money path, so it is a pure function with no I/O: every caller passes the
 * amounts that were actually charged and gets back the exact cents to refund.
 *
 * Everything is computed on the *cumulative* shortage (ordered − fulfilled)
 * rather than on a single adjustment. Subtracting the previous cumulative
 * refund from the new one makes repeated adjustments self-correcting: staff can
 * short an item, put one back, and short it again without ever double-refunding.
